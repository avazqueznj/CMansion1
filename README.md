# Chato's Mansion Game

Sharing a game done for learning Arduino, and to have fun with my kid.
The game is fast-paced; it is a small shooter, but with some added fun tricks.  I have not programmed in C++ for many years, so the style of the code will look funny, but let us know of any bugs or errors.

+ You can aim precisely in many angles 
+ You can shoot up to 2 bullets per sec, even as you change the aim angle
+ Be careful!!, the bullets will fly for a few seconds and ricochet all over

## Game play

+ Move sideways with [left] or [right]
+ Aim with [up]/[down]
+ Fire with [B]
+ Make one point for each ghost 
+ Lose two points if a bullet hits you
+ You die if a ghost touches you
+ Every 5 points you will level up, more ghosts will appear!!

Have fun.
